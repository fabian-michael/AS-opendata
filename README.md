# AS-opendata svelte app

This is a project template for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) apps. It lives at https://github.com/sveltejs/template-webpack.

To create a new project based on this template using [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit):

```bash
npx degit sveltejs/template-webpack svelte-app
cd svelte-app
```

*Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.*


## Get started

* Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

* Install yarn 

```bash
npm install -g yarn
```

* Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd svelte-app
yarn
```

...then start webpack:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and the page should reload with your changes.
